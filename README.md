Wifi Enabled Traffic Light

This is a ESP8266 (EPP01) based traffic light. I use this at work to indicate if the build/environment/burndown/whatever we feel like monitoring with a big red/green light, works.

Recently (7-2017) I did a rewrite of the code using platformio/Arduino as a base. Before that it was based on [esphttpd](https://github.com/Spritetm/esphttpd).
